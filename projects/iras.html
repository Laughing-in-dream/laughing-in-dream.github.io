              <p>
                Before I came to the United States, I weighed 155lbs(70kg) At a height of 5'7''(170 cm), I felt a bit overweight. However, after arriving in the U.S., possibly due to dietary changes and environmental factors,
                 my weight dropped to 143lbs(65kg) within just two months. I started going to the gym in November 2022. Initially, I was a beginner and didn't know how to use the gym equipment,
                  but fortunately, I had a friend with gym experience who helped me. Due to a good foundation, I made significant progress. 
                  However, my gym routine was interrupted in December when I contracted COVID-19. 
                  I returned to the gym after recovering from the illness and a persistent cough that lasted over a month .  </p>
              </p>
              <p>
                I am very strict with my training, aiming to go to the gym almost every day. However, due to various reasons like physical discomfort and homework, 
                I maintained a routine of working out five to six times a week. I  record each training session using an app, 
                noting the rest time between sets, and the weight, number of repetitions, and sets for each exercise. 
                I believe in quantifying my workouts to track progress. I think that if I am going to do something, I should do it well, 
                otherwise, the time and effort invested would be wasted, and I can just spend that time playing video games instead. Reviewing my progress also motivates me. 
                In natural bodybuilding, I believe that only lifting heavier weights over time helps in making progress. 
                I always aim to increase the weight in each session and set new targets after achieving the previous ones. 
                This approach has led to rapid improvements in my fitness.              </p>
              </p>

              <p>
                After about three to four months of training, I was able to bench press 200lbs(90kg).
                 However, I realized that I have strength, but I didn't appear muscular because my muscles were hidden under fat. 
                 While I was consuming a lot of protein, my weight had increased to 150lbs(68kg). Therefore, I decided to start cutting fat. 
                 Fat loss was challenging because it required strict control over the balance of eating, focusing on low carbohydrates, high protein, and low fat. 
                 I stopped eating any food outside of my main meals and avoided all drinks except water.
                  My diet consisted mainly of corn and brown rice. I also maintained daily aerobic exercises.
                  After two months of cutting, my weight dropped to 140lbs(64kg), but my strength did not decrease significantly. 
                  Eventually, I was able to bench press 215 pounds(97kg) and do weighted pull-ups with 70 pounds(32kg). 
                  After this, I stopped controlling my diet strictly, but my weight did not increase, probably because my body had adapted to the new weight. 
                  Now, living away from an apartment makes going to the gym inconvenient, but I still try to work out occasionally to maintain my fitness.
              </p>

              <p>I believe that regardless of gender, people admire those who are into fitness. This might be due to the aesthetic appeal of muscles, but fitness also represents hard work, perseverance, sweat, and possibly a demonstration of willpower. In the animal kingdom, muscles are a symbol of safety. This perception is a universal human value, sought after by many.

                For me, working out is more of an entertainment. I enjoy the feeling of my heart racing and the challenge of pushing my limits. 
                I admire my own body shape, which is also a result of my hard work. 
                I also enjoy the compliments from others. Fitness has given me a sense of superiority. 
                When people commend my workout efforts, I tell them that I am not a professional; I am just serious about it, and they can achieve it too. 
                Seeing others exercise inconsistently makes me feel that I am surpassing them. It coordinates with the saying, 
                "The road to success is not crowded, because there are few who persist." I am always willing to help others with fitness advice, 
                knowing how helpless I felt when I started and the many mistakes I made. I hope more and more people will join the fitness community, encouraging each other, 
                and making the world fall in love with fitness and exercise.
